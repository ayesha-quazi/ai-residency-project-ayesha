# AI-Residency-Project

Hi! I'm Ayesha Quazi, a recent Computer Science graduate preparing for a career in Software Development and AI.

Although I don't yet have a complete AI project to showcase, I'm currently building foundational skills and working toward creating something impactful during this residency. Here’s an overview of where I am and what I plan to do:

## 👩‍💻 Current Learning Focus
- C++ (via Abdul Bari’s course)
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Frontend development (React, JavaScript)
- Core CS subjects: OS, DBMS, CN

## 🤖 AI Interests
- Generative AI (LLMs like GPT-4)
- AI-powered web tools and assistants
- Automating frontend workflows with AI
- Open-source models and APIs

## 🛠️ Project Ideas for the Residency
- **AI-based resume analyzer**: Give feedback based on job roles
- **Frontend code assistant**: Suggests HTML/CSS improvements using LLM
- **Micro tools using OpenAI API**: Chatbots, text summarizers, etc.

## 🧠 Why This Residency
This is my opportunity to go from *learning* to *building*. I’m excited to be part of a community where I can grow fast, collaborate with others, and ship my first real AI product.

Stay tuned — I’ll be pushing regular updates here during the program!
